- 👋 Hi, I’m @zhangjialin
- 👀 I’m interested in Raspberry Pi, want to exercise my program coding ability
- 🌱 I’m learning two common development languages (C and Java) and how to use raspberry pie to do some common development
- 💞️ I want to master the programming language more skillfully and have a preliminary understanding of project development through my own exploration
- 📫 Record your exploration of raspberry pie through GitHub
